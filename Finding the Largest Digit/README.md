# Hello!
In this repository I have shared three assignments and two projects of Aipplied Machine Learning course lectured in winter 2018. In the following seections I have given explanation of each project. 

## 1. Linear Regression
This project is composed of 3 sections:
1. **Regression**: Fitting an n-degree polynomial to the data by minimizing MSE and experimenting effect of L2 regularization. 
2. **Gradient Descent for Regression**: fitting a linear regression model by minimizing MSE with SGD. 
3. **Experiments on Communities and Crime Data Set from the UCI repository**: We had to clean-up the model and handle the missing data by using KNN. Ridge-regression was used to fit a model on the data. 

## 2. Linear Classification and Nearest Neighbor Classification
In this classification project, data we had to generate two classes of data with provided means and covariance using Gaussian distribution. Then we used probabilistic LDA and k nearest neighbored algorithms to reach to the best accuracy and precision. To experiment different shape of boundaries found by probabilistic LDA, we used shared Vs. un-shared covariance for the Gaussian distributions. 

## 3. Sentiment Classification
In this project I implemented a sentiment classifier for Yelp 5 class rating reviews and IMDB binary classification problem. The data was vectorised by first creating a dictionary of words and assigning corresponding vector to each instance of the text corpus. Two vectorization methodologies were experimented including binary representation (existing or not-existing) and also frequency bag-of-words. Linear-SVM, Naive Bayes, and Decision Trees were used to classify these examples. 
	
## 5. Ablation study of TwinNets
In this project we had to do an ablation study of TwinNet, a bi-directional RNN being tested on sequential MNIST dataset. We also tried all possible machine learning baseline methodoligies as well as hyper-parameter exploration to reproduce the results. For more information, please read the report.
