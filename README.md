# Hello!
In this repository I have shared three assignments and two projects of Aipplied Machine Learning course lectured in winter 2018. In the following seections I have given explanation of each project. 

## 1. Linear Regression
This project is composed of 3 sections:
1. **Regression**: Fitting an n-degree polynomial to the data by minimizing MSE and experimenting effect of L2 regularization. 
2. **Gradient Descent for Regression**: fitting a linear regression model by minimizing MSE with SGD. 
3. **Experiments on Communities and Crime Data Set from the UCI repository**: We had to clean-up the model and handle the missing data by using KNN. Ridge-regression was used to fit a model on the data. 

## 2. Linear Classification and Nearest Neighbor Classification
